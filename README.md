## This is a simple EDA app on the work done with some health care dataset related to Los Angeles. This could be taken further to a data science project with a larger team to find the best possible health care or hospital near by using GPS. Some of the attributes to recommend a hospital or healthcare to the residents could be the insurance provider, total charges covered, number of beds available, closest one and much more.

## Some preview from the app
